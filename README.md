# Protein-Secondary-Structure-Classification
Using Deep Learning to detect hierarchical feature representation and build prediction model for protein secondary structure
<h2>Overview</h2>
This is the summer project that I worked with Professor Brian King about using Deep Learning to predict secondary structure 
prediction. So far, the project contains a few folders, each of which is a runnable piece of code using different algorithm to
build prediction model. I uploaded this to Github because this project appeared on my resume. However, as I continued my project
I will try to get things a little bit more organized. Please feel free to pull my code or give any comments onto my project!
<h2>Recognition</h2>
Some neural network algorithm in the project was builted based on exercises from Stanford's UFLDL website http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/tutorial/
